# Physiomate Health Monitoring System

This was an app developed for a University project where I coded the frontend using HTML, CSS and JS and the backend using a NodeJS/Express/Socketio/Johnny-Five integration.
Arduino is needed for this project along with Pulse Sensor SEN-11574. Connections can be found in the relevant sensor docs.

Please download the code files to view the app (without backend functionality, unless you also have an Arduino). See also the image below for what the app looks like.
Please contact jaberabdulhalim@gmail.com for the report of this project if you would like to learn more.
